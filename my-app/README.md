# REACT MOVIE APP
- This is a movie app which uses react to render it's details and other functionalities eg. searching for
a movie

- It will use an API to get its data and will be built using react.

-This app will also be deployed on netlify


## Setup
- Run `npm run server` to get the backend started

- Run `npm start` to get the front-end displayed on the browser

- Run `npm build` to build the app for production to the build folder to enable deployment.

## Endpoints

The base URL for my backend is: `https://localhost:3000`

The endpoint needed is: `https://api.themoviedb.org/3`
The Api key I used is `&api_key=f4ccf89c2ee6e3bece6132fb34133822`;

## Core Deliverables

A user should be able to:

- See movies displayed on their UI when you click on the links.
- Search for movies when they enter the title of the movie in the search bar.
- view description when they hover on the title of the movie. The description is shown as overview.
