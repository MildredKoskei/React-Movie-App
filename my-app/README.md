# REACT MOVIE APP

## Endpoints

The base URL for my backend is: `https://api.themoviedb.org/3`
The Api key I used is `&api_key=f4ccf89c2ee6e3bece6132fb34133822`;

## Core Deliverables

A usee should be able to:

- See movies displayed on their UI.
- Search for movies when they enter the title of the movie in the search bar.
- view description when they hover on the title of the movie. The description is shown as overview.
